### Recap on doing this project 
1. SQLite database (local database)
2. Adapter
 - An Adapter object acts as a bridge between an AdapterView and the underlying data for that view.

3. Recycler View
 - Recycler view allow us to implement horizontal, vertical and expandable list.

4. Data Access Object (DAO)
 - This is where we can define our interaction with the database

## Future Improvement
1. PIN/UNPIN function will bring the notes to the top of the notes application
2. Allow user to determine the color of each individual notes
3. Allow user to change font size, and include images in the notes
